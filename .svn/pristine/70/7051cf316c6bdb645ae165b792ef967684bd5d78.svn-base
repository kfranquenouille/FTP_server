How to start the FTP server :
	java -jar FTPserver.jar
	
When you compile, there is no warnings. The server works with the FTP client in the shell, Mozilla Firefox and Filezilla (we have use the EPLF https://filezilla-project.org/specs/eplf.html).
	
Tests :
 - you need to create a folder using root named "locked" in the directory /tmp/ (in order to not remove some system files)
 - create a file named "test" with an user account in the directory /tmp/
 
To connect, your can use theses accounts :
 - user : test		pass : test
 - user : damdam	pass : damdam
 - user : anonymous
 
We can connect 5 users at the same time for example. However, we have implemented the passive mode and the anonymous mode.

Working clients :
 - FTP in the shell
 - Filezilla
 - Mozilla Firefox
